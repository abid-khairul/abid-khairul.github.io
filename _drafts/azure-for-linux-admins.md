Azure is MicroSoft so by default any Linux admin would stay away from them.

However sometimes you can't due to your employer going down the Azure cloud platform route. This maybe due to price or some sales discount or other factor.

There are api's for managing Azure through python and also a linux cli. These all connect to the rest api. However if you want to 
get access to the wealth of examples and sample scripts out there you're going to have to learn PowerShell. After getting some used to the
ISE IDE like environment it's not that hard. But you do need to make the leap!
