            If you thought the .io root domain at the end of many URLs stood for
            input/output then you're wrong.<br /><br />What's worse the root
            domain may be erased in the near future because of politics.<br /><br />.io
            is the country code for the British Indian Ocean Territory. It's
            sovereignty has been disputed for decades but in the past month the
            British government has announced it is handing the territory over to
            Mauritius.<br /><br />When this happens the British Indian Ocean
            Territory will no longer exist.<br /><br />This begs the question -
            what will happen to the .io top-level domain extension?<br /><br />The
            Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages the top-level
            domains. After the handover is complete no new .io domain will be
            allowed and itâ€™s expected the top-level domain will be phased out.

            blown each year from the Sahara desert. This contains phosphorus, a
            vital mineral for plant growth. About a similar amount is lost from
            the Amazon due to rainfall and flooding. This cycle of weather
            patterns replenishes the nutrients needs to sustain plant life.<br /><br />What

            It's so easy to overlook internet users with disabilities.<br /><br />While
            coding my own website I learnt about \"Accessible Rich Internet
            Applications\" (ARIA) attributes that can be embedded in websites to
            aid screen readers make your site more usable.<br /><br />Tech has
            advanced so much, letâ€™s use it to bring everyone along.

            I once entered a funny speech contest and knew I had very little
            chance of winning but would give it a go anyway.<br /><br />After
            the contest I got to see the marking criteria and bizarrely only 20%
            of the marks were for funny content!<br /><br />The rest was things
            like use of the stage, vocal variety, body language, etc.<br /><br />Sometimes
            to win you need to bend into the shape of the marking criteria and
            that definitely feels like gaming the system.
